    <h3 class="subtitles">The creator</h3>
    <p>The creator of this project is Avi Agola. Commonly known as Phytonking on Github. <br>
        He sees how the internet of things (IoT) is used in most day to day life and wanted to design a free service
        of open-source IoT-programming.
    </p><br>
    <p style="color: grey; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;"> - "Iot is becoming a free space to output cretivity, bringing progress to internet techonology." </p>

    <h3 class="subtitles">The system</h3>
    <p>The project has 3 components: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <div class="w3-card w3-blue-grey">
                <h5 style="text-align: center;">Device</h5><br>
                <p>The device which could generate data and would be operated remotely. <br> 
                Coded in python. The device can send signals to the global server to the Cloud servers for the most up-to-date data. </p>
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="w3-card w3-dark-grey">
                <h5 style="text-align: center;">Cloud Server</h5><br>
                <p>This server operates independently and recieves and sends data to the device and interface server. </p>
            </div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="w3-card w3-grey">
                <h5 style="text-align: center;">Interface Server</h5><br>
                <p>This website is the interface server, where you can access your device's data and be able to send commands to your devices (Work in progress). </p>
            </div>
        </li>
    </ul>
